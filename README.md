# wrapstatus-vscode-extension
Adds a status bar item in VS Code (and VSCodium) to show current wrap status and allow changing without affecting settings

This will display the current wrap setting on the status bar. For those wrap settings that are dependant on the setting defining the wrap column ('bounded', which is shortest of window boundary and the wrap column, or the 'wordWrapColumn').

## Acknowledgements
This extension is based upon the sample statusbar from https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples
